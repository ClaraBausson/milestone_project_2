# Budget vizualisation website
ðŸ”¸ Milestone Project #2: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute

## Overview
This project is a website used to display and easily visualize budget data. The primary goal is to easily visualize the various categories, incomes and expenses from the data, and directly interact with the dashboard.

## Deployment
The live project url is https://clarabausson.github.io/milestone_project_2/. 
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://github.com/ClaraBausson/milestone_project_2.git into your terminal.

## UX
The main goal for this project was to make it as easy as possible for users to visualize and understand the data. The color scheme is pastel with a focus on light blue-green and pink, to keep the website minimalistic and simple.
